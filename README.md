> Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m currently working on [a Petroleum Reservoir Simulation Library in Python](https://github.com/zakgrin/reservoirflow).

## About Me

I am a Data Scientist and Data Engineer at [Schaeffler](https://www.linkedin.com/company/schaeffler/mycompany/verification/).

I have more than 4 years of experience working on data science projects mainly related to sales, simulation, and people analytics. One of my projects was to build reliable real-time intelligent dashboards using SQL, Python, and MS Power BI to achieve better business strategies.

I am a master of data science graduate from [Frankfurt School](https://www.frankfurt-school.de/home). Before studying data science, I worked as a simulation engineer and did a master's degree in petroleum reservoir engineering and business management at [TU Clausthal](https://www.tu-clausthal.de/). I also did my bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering at [University of Tripoli](https://uot.edu.ly/index.php?lang=en). Scientific computing and engineering are both essential parts of my background. Adding data science to my background has helped me to be a proficient scientist/engineer who can test and prove scientific knowledge by coding. 

I am very interested in developing scalable AI systems that can benefit others. My master thesis is a great example of my efforts where I built a face recognition system that can be used to secure gatherings and crowds in compliance with GDPR. 

Meanwhile, I am still learning to improve my skills in the German language, Data Engineering, Cloud Services (Azure, GCP, AWS), VMs, Containers (Docker), C++, Java, and web apps. I am looking forward to improving my technical skills, learning from others, and supporting my communities (i.e. reservoir engineering, data science, and scientific computing).
